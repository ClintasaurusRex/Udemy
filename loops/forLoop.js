// for loops are used to iterate over a sequence of values.

// The for loop has the following syntax:

// for (initialization; condition; final-expression) {
//   // code to be executed
// }
// The initialization statement is executed only once at the beginning. It is used to initialize the loop variable. The condition is evaluated before each iteration, and if it is true, the code inside the loop is executed. The final-expression is executed at the end of each iteration. It is usually used to increment or decrement the loop variable. The loop continues until the condition evaluates to false. Here is an example of a for loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 5:

for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
